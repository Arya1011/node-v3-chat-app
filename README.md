# Node.js Chatting App
> A duplex communication chat-app built using the popular library socket.io which allows users to send text messages to other users in the same room,also allowing users to join a particular room with the room name.It has the additional functionality of sharing their respective locations,with a link to Google Maps using the MDN geolocation API. 

Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.

It is built on top of the WebSocket protocol and provides additional guarantees like fallback to HTTP long-polling or automatic reconnection.
